    <h1>Using a Decorative Custom Font with Google Fonts</h1>
    <p>Welcome! This page uses a custom font called "Lobster", which is quite unusual and decorative. The font is loaded from Google Fonts using the <code>@import</code> rule in the HTML head section, making it easy to use.</p>

    <h2>More About the Lobster Font</h2>
    <p>The **Lobster font** is well-known for its bold, curly, and playful style. It's a script font, which means the letters are designed to look more like handwriting, but with a strong, artistic flair. This gives the text a lot of personality, making it stand out in a way that regular fonts can't.</p>

    <p>**Lobster** is particularly great when you want something eye-catching, such as for headers or titles. It's often used in logos, posters, or for any design that needs to convey a fun, creative, or quirky vibe. However, because of its bold and decorative nature, it’s best to use Lobster – mainly for headings or key sections – as it can be overwhelming if used for body text.</p>

    <h2>How I Used Lobster on This Page</h2>
    <p>For this page, I’ve used the **Lobster font** as the main font to give it a unique and creative look. Instead of relying on common fonts that are installed on most computers, we’re pulling Lobster from Google Fonts, which is a free and easy-to-use online library of fonts.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Step 1: Adding the Font:</strong> I added a link to the Lobster font in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of our HTML. This tells the browser to load the font from Google Fonts’ servers when someone visits this page.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2: Applying the Font:</strong> Once the font is loaded, I use <code>font-family: 'Lobster'</code> in our CSS to apply it to the entire page. This makes all the text, including headers and paragraphs, appear in the Lobster font, giving the page a distinct style.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The best part about using Google Fonts is that we don't have to worry about storing the font file ourselves. It’s as simple as adding one line of code to link to the font, and it works on most modern browsers.</p>

    <p>In summary, Lobster is a bold and artistic font that’s perfect for adding some flair to your design, it's incredibly easy to use.</p>

    <h1>Using a Decorative Custom Font with Google Fonts</h1>
    <p>Welcome! This page now uses a custom font called "Lobster", which is quite unusual and decorative. The font is loaded from Google Fonts using the <code>@import</code> rule in the HTML head section, making it easy to use.</p>

    <h2>How the Custom Font Works</h2>
    <p>The font we’re using here is called **"Lobster"**. It's not the type of font you usually see on most web pages. Instead, it has a playful and curly style, which is why it stands out. If you're tired of the same old boring fonts, Lobster is a fun way to shake things up a bit!</p>

    <p>Instead of hosting the font ourselves, we’re using a service called **Google Fonts**. This service provides free access to a huge library of fonts like Lobster. Here’s what happens:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Linking to Google Fonts:</strong> We add a special link in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of our HTML file that tells the browser to go fetch the Lobster font from Google’s servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Applying the Font:</strong> Once the browser grabs the font, we use <code>font-family: 'Lobster'</code> in our CSS to apply it to the text. This tells the browser to use Lobster for everything on the page instead of the default fonts.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Why is this helpful? By linking to Google Fonts, we don’t need to worry about storing or serving the font files ourselves. Google handles all of that for us, and it loads quickly and works on almost every browser. Plus, the font is loaded only when someone visits the page, so it doesn't take up extra space on our server.</p>

    <p>In short, we get to use a really unique font with very little effort, giving our page a playful, custom look.</p>
